The AI engineer's work involved an initial project setup and extensive feature development for a React/FastAPI/Supabase application. Key initial challenges included Vite configuration, dependency management, Stripe integration via Supabase Edge Functions (after abandoning a FastAPI approach), and setting up Supabase tables with RLS. The subsequent phase focused on building an admin panel for video styles, which involved creating  and handling Supabase interactions. The most recent and significant effort revolved around enhancing the Video Oluştur (Video Create) page's UI/UX. This included addressing a black screen bug, refactoring the form to a single page, adding numerous dropdowns with custom options (Gender, Age, Location, Sector, Prompt Type), incorporating emojis, customizing display text and icons for format selection, and implementing a custom warning modal. The engineer also modified the homepage slider component, updated a comparison table, added a GIF slider placeholder, and attempted (unsuccessfully due to permission issues) to update Supabase entries for video styles. A recent black screen issue on the landing page was resolved by the .

<pending_tasks>
-   **Supabase Video Style Update (Fitness to Balık Gözü)**: The user wants to rename Fitness video style to Balık Gözü and replace its video with . The AI engineer attempted this via script but failed due to Supabase RLS/permissions with the  key. This requires manual update by the user in Supabase or using a service role key.
-   **Supabase Admin Role for Video Styles**: The  table RLS needs to be updated to enforce  role-based access for management, as discussed in the initial analysis.
-   **GIFs for Sector Slider**: The GIF/video slider in the Tüm Sektörler İçin Akıllı Çözüm section on  is currently a placeholder. Real GIF/video assets need to be provided by the user and integrated.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a black screen issue on the application preview. This was a critical bug that appeared after recent UI modifications to , specifically after adding the placeholder GIF slider. Although TypeScript checks passed, supervisor logs indicated a Babel parse error related to JSX in . After two attempts to fix it directly, the  was invoked. The  successfully resolved the issue, confirming that the frontend is now working correctly and returning HTTP 200, and that the JSX syntax was correct all along, implying a transient environment or build issue was resolved.

The user's last explicit request was to change the name of the Fitness video style to Balık Gözü (Fish Eye). This task involves updating a record in the Supabase  table. The AI engineer previously downloaded the  file and attempted to update Supabase programmatically using a Node.js script and the provided , but this failed due to insufficient permissions (RLS policies) for the  key. The Fitness style remains in the database.

<optional_next_step>
I will provide the user with the necessary Supabase SQL command to manually rename Fitness to Balık Gözü and update its video path, as direct programmatic access failed.
