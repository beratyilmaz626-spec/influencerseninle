<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was to set up a project from a provided ZIP file without any modifications. This evolved through several stages:
1.  A request to perform visual-only UI/UX enhancements without altering any application logic.
2.  A more aggressive UI/UX redesign, changing layouts while preserving all functionality.
3.  A migration of the application's backend from MongoDB to a new Supabase project.
4.  A request to set up the database schema in the new Supabase project using the original migration files found in the initial ZIP archive.
5.  Troubleshooting admin login failures and populating the database with schema and sample data from the original project.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
- A full-stack application with a React/Vite frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- The project's backend has been migrated to use a new Supabase project ().
- Both frontend and backend  files and configuration files () have been updated with the new Supabase credentials.
- An admin user () has been correctly created in Supabase Auth, resolving initial login issues.
- The Supabase database is partially set up; it currently contains the  table and a  from previous debugging steps.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was guiding the user to manually execute a consolidated SQL script in the Supabase SQL Editor. This script is intended to create all the necessary tables (, , , etc.) and populate them with sample data as defined in the original project's migration files. This manual approach was adopted after automated methods (direct DB connection, Supabase CLI) failed due to container network restrictions and binary incompatibilities.
- **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing by python -c. The agent must first verify that all tables have been created successfully. This can be done by running a Python script that uses the Supabase client to list all tables in the  schema.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0):** The Supabase database schema is incomplete and does not match the original project's requirements.
  - **Description:** Core application functionality is broken because most required tables (, , , etc.) are missing from the database.
  - **Attempted fixes:**
    -   Agent's direct database connection attempts failed due to container network restrictions.
    -   Supabase CLI installation failed due to incompatible binary architecture.
    -   User's manual SQL execution failed multiple times due to running incorrect/partial scripts, destructive action warnings, and a critical issue where the Supabase UI auto-translated the English SQL commands into Turkish, causing syntax errors.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    1.  Wait for the user to confirm they have run the final, correct SQL script provided in message #456.
    2.  Execute a Python script to connect to the Supabase API and list all tables in the  schema.
    3.  Verify the list contains: , , , , , , , and .
    4.  If tables are still missing, re-engage the user, reminding them to ensure their Supabase UI language is set to English before running the script.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The application is not functional without its database schema. This fix will complete the database setup, enabling all backend and frontend features.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** Y
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
  - **Blocked on other issue:** Blocked on the user successfully executing the SQL script.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete and Verify Supabase Database Schema**
  - **Where to resume:** The agent has provided the final, correct SQL script (message #456). The next action is to confirm with the user that it was executed and then programmatically verify the existence of all required tables.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** A fully functional database schema that mirrors the original project's design, including sample data.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
  - **Blocked on something:** User action.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **(P0) Full System Test:** Once the database schema is confirmed, perform an end-to-end test. This includes logging in as the admin, navigating the dashboard, and verifying that data from the new tables (e.g., slider videos, user credits) is displayed correctly.
  - **(P1) UI/UX Redesign Verification:** The user repeatedly reported not seeing the UI changes. After the database is fixed, this must be re-validated. The agent should use the  tool to see what its own environment renders to distinguish between a build/cache issue and a user-side browser issue.

**Completed work in this session**
- Project successfully set up from a ZIP file (initially with MongoDB).
- Extensive UI/UX redesigns applied to , , and .
- Debugged and fixed a critical JSX syntax error in .
- Migrated the application's configuration from MongoDB to a new Supabase project.
- Updated all relevant frontend and backend files with the new Supabase credentials.
- Successfully created an admin user in Supabase Authentication, resolving login problems.
- Identified and diagnosed multiple root causes for SQL execution failures, including network restrictions and browser auto-translation issues.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Frontend UI changes are not visible to the user.**
  - **Debug checklist:** This is a recurring problem likely caused by aggressive caching (Vite build cache or browser cache). The agent has tried restarting services but has not yet used the  tool to verify the rendered output from its side. This should be the next step to diagnose the issue if it persists.
  - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** To ensure the user can see and approve the significant UI/UX work that was completed per their request.
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend.
  - **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** Migrated from MongoDB to **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
- **Environment:** Docker container managed by .

**key DB schema**
The following tables are expected to be in the  schema after the user runs the final SQL script:
- : {id, email, role, created_at}
- : {id, user_id, name, status, video_url, ...}
- : {id, user_id, credits, ...}
- : {id, user_id, amount, transaction_type, ...}
- : {id, title, video_url, display_order, ...}
- : {id, user_id, stripe_customer_id, ...}
- : {id, user_id, stripe_payment_intent_id, ...}
- : {id, user_id, stripe_subscription_id, ...}

**All files**
- **Created:**
  - , : Iteratively corrected SQL scripts for database schema creation. The last one is the most relevant.
  - : A Python script to create a user in Supabase Auth via API.
- **Updated:**
  - : Added Supabase credentials.
  - : Added Supabase credentials.
  - : Updated to point to the new Supabase project.
  - , , : Heavily modified for UI/UX redesign.
  - : Added custom CSS animations.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Database setup is manual for the user.** The agent's container has network restrictions preventing direct DB or CLI access. The only working method is to provide SQL to the user.
- **SQL Auto-Translation Bug:** The user's Supabase UI was auto-translating SQL to Turkish, causing syntax errors. The user has been instructed to set their UI language to English. Be aware of this if generating more SQL.
- **Project Standardization:** The application is now standardized on the **new Supabase project ()**. The old project mentioned in the history should be ignored.
- **Caching Issues:** The user has repeatedly been unable to see frontend changes. If this issue reappears, use the  tool to verify the render output from the agent's side before assuming it's a user-side browser cache problem.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
- **User:** Reports an error after pasting SQL; the agent identifies it's due to auto-translation.
- **User:** Asks if they should delete existing tables before running new SQL.
- **User:** Expresses confusion over the multiple SQL scripts provided throughout the conversation.
- **User:** Confirms tamam (ok) after running a single-table creation script.
- **User:** Confirms tamam (ok) after being given the final, consolidated SQL script. The agent is waiting to verify if this action was successful.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The entire application is non-functional until the database schema is correctly created.
- **Mocked:** N/A.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** None
- **Known regressions:** The application is currently in a broken state due to the incomplete database migration.
