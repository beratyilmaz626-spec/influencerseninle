<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was to implement a robust, tiered, monthly subscription model to control feature access and usage limits for their SaaS application, InfluencerSeninle. This involved moving away from a simple credit-based system to a plan-based one (Başlangıç, Profesyonel, Kurumsal) with specific monthly video creation limits. The payment provider was specified as Iyzico, not Stripe.

Subsequently, the user issued a critical directive to focus exclusively on UI/UX and responsiveness improvements. The goal was to make the existing, functional application fully responsive and visually consistent across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) without altering any backend logic, state management, or core functionalities. All UI text must be in Turkish.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Goal 1 (Completed):** Implement a tiered, monthly subscription model with Iyzico.
-   **Goal 2 (Completed):** Make the entire application fully responsive, mobile-first, without breaking any existing business logic.
-   **Theme:** All UI must adhere to the Holographic Matte Black premium theme.
-   **Language:** All user-facing UI text must be in **Turkish**.
-   **Subscription Tiers:**
    -   **Başlangıç (0/ay):** 20 videos/month.
    -   **Profesyonel (0/ay):** 45 videos/month.
    -   **Kurumsal (0/ay):** 100 videos/month.
-   **Strict Constraint:** **NO** changes to existing business logic, state management, or API calls unless it's for UI/responsive fixes.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React (Vite) frontend and FastAPI backend using Supabase. The monthly subscription system has been fully implemented on both the frontend and backend, including plan-based feature access, usage limit checks, and UI components for displaying subscription status. The entire application has undergone a major responsive overhaul and is now optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Pricing information has been synchronized across the landing page and the user dashboard.

-   **Status:** RESOLVED. The agent performed a comprehensive responsive UI overhaul, which addressed the root cause of these inconsistencies across different viewports. The next agent should still be mindful of maintaining consistency.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS (mobile-first, responsive), shadcn/ui, Framer Motion
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
-   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
-   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
-   **Payment Provider:** Iyzico (conceptually integrated; backend logic expects it)
-   **External Services:** N8N for video generation workflows.

**key DB schema**
-   : {id, email, full_name, is_admin}
-   : {id, user_id, name, status: processing | completed | failed}
-   : {id, user_id, plan_id, status, provider, current_period_start, current_period_end}

**changes in tech stack**
-   **Payment Provider:** The project's business logic now assumes **Iyzico** is the payment provider, not Stripe. Stripe-related files (, ) exist but have been repurposed or are conceptually deprecated.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx**: Heavily modified for responsive design and subscription UI integration.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/LandingPage.tsx**: Heavily modified for responsive design and content updates.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AuthModal.tsx**: Modified for mobile responsiveness.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/SubscriptionPanel.tsx**: Modified for content updates.
-   **/app/frontend/src/hooks/useSubscriptionAccess.ts**: Updated with robust subscription and period validation logic.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Updated to include the new subscription routes.
-   **/app/backend/subscription_routes.py**: **New.** Contains all backend business logic for the subscription system.
-   **/app/frontend/src/config/subscription-plans.ts**: The source of truth for plan features.
-   **/app/frontend/src/stripe-config.ts**: Updated with correct pricing (0, 0, 0).
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**: Added global .

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx**: This file is still a large monolith. The logic for different views (, , ) could be broken into separate components to improve maintainability.
-   **/app/frontend/src/stripe-config.ts**: This file should be renamed to something more generic like  to avoid confusion, as Stripe is no longer the payment provider.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Returns all available subscription plans.
-   : (POST) Backend check if a user is authorized to create a video.
-   : (POST) Increments a user's video usage count for the current period.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Responsive Design is a Core Requirement:** The user is very sensitive to how the application looks and functions on mobile devices. Any new feature must be built mobile-first and tested on various screen sizes.
-   **No Logic Changes:** The user has strictly forbidden any changes to existing, working business logic. Only UI/UX or explicitly requested feature changes are allowed.
-   **Payment Provider is Iyzico:** Do not implement or refer to Stripe. All payment-related logic should be based on the conceptual Iyzico integration.
-   **Language is Turkish:** All user-facing text must be in Turkish.

**documents and test_reports created in this job**
-   : Updated multiple times to define and run backend and frontend test cases for the subscription system.
